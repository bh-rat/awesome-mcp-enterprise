Thank you for your interest in contributing to Awesome MCP Enterprise! This guide will help you understand how to contribute effectively.

## Before You Submit

### Understanding the Scope

This repository lists **infrastructure, platforms, and services for building, hosting, running, and securing MCP servers**. We do **not** list MCP servers themselves or agent frameworks that use MCP.

**In scope:** tools and platforms that help enterprises:
- Build and develop MCP servers (SDKs, frameworks, inspectors)
- Host, deploy, and scale MCP servers (infrastructure, cloud platforms)
- Secure, govern, and observe MCP servers (security, identity, audit)
- Discover and manage MCP servers (registries, gateways, proxies, directories)

**Out of scope:**
- MCP servers themselves (e.g., "an MCP server for Slack" or "an agent with 50+ MCP tools")
- Agent frameworks that consume MCP tools but don't provide MCP infrastructure
- Badges, certifications, or branding additions to this README
- New categories. We are not adding new sections at this time.

> **Not sure?** Open an issue first to discuss whether your tool fits before submitting a PR.

### Required Criteria
- **Production-Ready**: The tool/service must be in production or GA (General Availability) stage (beta tools may be accepted if clearly marked with 🧪)
- **Actively Maintained**: Last update within 6 months, responsive to issues
- **Clear Documentation**: Must have comprehensive documentation for enterprise deployment
- **Working Links**: Your product website or repository must be live and functional
- **MCP-Specific**: Must be specifically designed for or compatible with Model Context Protocol
- **Enterprise-Focused**: Should address enterprise needs (security, compliance, scalability, etc.)

### Quality Standards
- No abandoned projects (no updates for 12+ months)
- Must have a working website or GitHub repository
- Verifiable compliance certifications (if claimed)
